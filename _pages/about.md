Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu) at [The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu), where I am affiliated with the [Program for Public Discourse](https://publicdiscourse.unc.edu), the [Institute for the Study of the Americas](https://isa.unc.edu), and the [Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning](https://gradprofdev.unc.edu/cirtl-unc-chapel-hill/). My work is also funded by the National Science Foundation's [Graduate Research Fellowship](http://nsfgrfp.org). I previously received my MA in Political Science from UNC-Chapel Hill in 2020 and my BA in History, Political Science, and Economics from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) in 2018. Broadly, my research investigates public opinion and political behavior in both comparative and American contexts, as well as methodological topics related to my substantive areas of interest.
