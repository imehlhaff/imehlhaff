Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu) at The University of Chicago, where I am also affiliated with the [Department of Political Science](https://political-science.uchicago.edu). Beginning in fall 2024, I will be an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://bush.tamu.edu/pols/) at Texas A&M University. 

My research is driven by substantive questions in public opinion and political psychology: How and why do citizens change their attitudes on political issues? How do these attitude changes drive mass polarization? How is polarization causally related to other features of government and society? As a computational social scientist, I answer these questions by using and developing rigorous methods in natural language processing, Bayesian statistics, and causal inference, with a particular focus on high-quality measurement. 

I received my PhD in 2023 from the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu) at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I previously received my MA. I also hold a BA in History, Political Science, and Economics from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://polisci.wisc.edu). My work has been funded by the [National Science Foundation](http://nsfgrfp.org) and the [American Political Science Association](https://www.apsanet.org/centennial), among others.
