Welcome! I am an incoming Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu) at The University of Chicago. Beginning in fall 2024, I will be an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://bush.tamu.edu/pols/) at Texas A&M University. I will receive my PhD in summer 2023 from the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu) at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I have been affiliated with the [Program for Public Discourse](https://publicdiscourse.unc.edu), the [Institute for the Study of the Americas](https://isa.unc.edu), and the [Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning](https://gradprofdev.unc.edu/cirtl-unc-chapel-hill/). My work is also funded by the National Science Foundation's [Graduate Research Fellowship](http://nsfgrfp.org). I previously received my MA in Political Science from UNC-Chapel Hill in 2020 and my BA in History, Political Science, and Economics from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://polisci.wisc.edu) in 2018.

My research is driven by substantive questions in public opinion and political psychology: How and why do citizens change their attitudes on political issues? How do these attitude changes drive mass polarization? How is polarization causally related to other features of government and society? As a computational social scientist, I answer these questions by using and developing rigorous methods in natural language processing, Bayesian statistics, and causal inference, with a particular focus on high-quality measurement.
