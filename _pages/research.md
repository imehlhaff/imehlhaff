> Political polarization is a key concern in many important topics within the social sciences, yet many of the measures currently on offer may be unreliable or lack strong construct validity. The rapidly expanding literature on polarization emphasizes two key dynamics: distance and concentration of a distribution’s component groups. I argue that the most common measurement strategies do not capture polarization as it is conceptualized in the literature because they either ignore one of the two dynamics, provide unreliable estimates of the dynamic they do capture, or struggle to take more than one variable into account. To provide a path forward, I use clustering methods to derive the cluster-polarization coefficient (CPC), a novel measure of multimodal data structuration that scales to high-dimensional analysis, accepts a wide variety of data structures, and enables comparison across diverse spatiotemporal contexts. I present Monte Carlo simulations to show that the CPC predicts distributional polarization with greater accuracy than current measures and I demonstrate its application to the relationship between economic inequality and polarization in the United States Congress. An open-source <kbd>R</kbd> package implements the measure for several popular clustering procedures.

> This paper examines government work relief programs created by President Roosevelt’s
Hundred Days Congress aimed at immediate relief, namely, the Civil Works Administration. While the symbolic importance of these programs must be acknowledged, there is some evidence that these programs had little overall effect on recovery. They may have improved the lives of some Americans in the short run, although it is unclear how many Americans truly benefited. That is the question to be addressed by my research: Did the programs aimed at addressing the unemployment crisis work in the immediate context of the period for the demographic groups toward whom they were addressed? My empirical model aims to evaluate the association between work relief spending and private sector employment across diverse industries. I find industry-specific growth rates to be highly volatile, generally negative in the aggregate, and uncorrelated with work relief spending. Given my empirical evaluation, I posit that the sudden influx of money from New Deal work relief programs played a role in sustaining the retail industry through the later years of the Great Depression, but this benefit did not extend to wholesale or manufacturing. The Civil Works Administration was valuable because it put a few dollars in the pockets of desperate Americans, but the far-reaching economic impact claimed by Roosevelt’s administration most likely did not materialize as a result of this program.
