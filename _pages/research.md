> Political polarization is a key concern in many important topics within the social sciences, yet many of the measures currently on offer may be unreliable or lack strong construct validity. The rapidly expanding literature on polarization emphasizes two key dynamics: distance and concentration of a distributionâ€™s component groups. I argue that the most common measurement strategies do not capture polarization as it is conceptualized in the literature because they either ignore one of the two dynamics, provide unreliable estimates of the dynamic they do capture, or struggle to take more than one variable into account. To provide a path forward, I use clustering methods to derive the cluster-polarization coefficient (CPC), a novel measure of multimodal data structuration that scales to high-dimensional analysis, accepts a wide variety of data structures, and enables comparison across diverse spatiotemporal contexts. I present Monte Carlo simulations to show that the CPC predicts distributional polarization with greater accuracy than current measures and I demonstrate its application to the relationship between economic inequality and polarization in the United States Congress. An open-source <kbd>R</kbd> package implements the measure for several popular clustering procedures.
