> The United States underperformed its potential in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using original survey data from April 2020 to March 2022, we show that political partisanship may have contributed to this inconsistent response by distinguishing elites and citizens who took the crisis seriously from those who did not. This division was not inevitable; when the crisis began, Democrats and Republicans differed little in their viewpoints and actions. However, partisans increasingly diverged when their preferred political leaders provided them with opposing cues. We outline developments in party politics over the last half-century that contributed to partisan division on COVID-19, most centrally an anti-expertise bias among Republicans. Accordingly, Republicans’ support for mitigation measures, perception of severity of COVID-19, and support for vaccines gradually decreased after the initial outbreak. Partisan differences also showed up at the state level; Trump’s vote share in 2016 was negatively associated with mask use and positively associated with COVID-19 infections. Diverging elite cues provided fertile ground for the partisan pandemic, underscoring the importance of political accountability, even in an era of polarization.

> Despite its growing importance in social scientific topics, the quantitative measurement of polarization has lagged behind its conceptual development. Political and social polarization are group-based phenomena characterized by intergroup heterogeneity and intragroup homogeneity, but existing measures capture only one of these features or make it difficult to compare across cases or over time. To bring the concept and measurement of polarization into closer alignment, I introduce the cluster-polarization coefficient (CPC), a measure of multimodality that allows scholars to incorporate multiple variables and compare across contexts with varying numbers of parties or social groups. Simulation exercises and three applications to ideological and affective polarization demonstrate that the CPC returns more substantively sensible results than other popular measures. An open-source software package implements the measure.

> Contemporary American politics has been largely characterized by hyper-partisanship and polarization, with partisan motivated reasoning a thematic concern. Theories of emotions in politics suggest that anxiety might interrupt partisan heuristics and encourage citizens to reason more evenhandedly—but in what domains and to what extent? We use original panel data to assess how anxiety about becoming seriously ill from Covid-19 interacted with partisan attachments to shape political judgment during the Covid-19 pandemic. The structure of our data allows us to assess large-scale implications of politically relevant emotions in ways that so far have not been possible. We find large effects on policy attitudes: Republicans who were afraid of getting sick rejected signals from co-partisan leaders by supporting mask mandates and the like. Effects on vote choice were muted in comparison, but, in a race as close as the 2020 presidential election, were potentially large enough to have been pivotal.

> In addition to interest in undergraduate research, political science increasingly recognizes the value of civically engaged research for various educational, professional, and civic outcomes. With limited time and steep tradeoffs, instructors must find ways to cleverly combine undergraduate research experiences with the broader normative civic-education responsibilities of political science and higher education. This article presents a course design that allows instructors to leverage their classroom for both civic education and undergraduate research without the need for previously developed community partnerships that are common to most engaged research and learning. Our approach brings together undergraduate research and community engagement through course design.

  <summary markdown="span">Abstract</summary>
> As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, public responses increasingly divided along political lines: Democrats tended to support policies and behaviors recommended by public health experts and Republicans tended to oppose them. We argue that exclusively party-based explanations for these patterns are incomplete. Instead, we call attention to people’s philosophy about life—their “worldview"— as an important force behind their pandemic responses. We posit that citizens use beliefs derived from interactions with their everyday life to inform their affinities and preferences when analogous matters enter the political realm. Using original cross-sectional and panel survey data gathered over the course of the pandemic, we theorize and empirically validate a multidimensional measure of worldview. We show that worldview is a coherent, belief-system-like entity that remained stable during the pandemic, suggesting its centrality in mass responses to uncertain and novel stimuli. We then show that even before strong party cues emerged, worldview structured Americans’ reactions to COVID-19 and constrained the positions parties could take. Worldview’s influence was both direct and indirect, channeled through its relationship with partisan preference. While partisanship is a potent force in political belief systems, much of its effect, we suggest, comes from its association with people’s general philosophy about life.

> Scholars consistently find that most people do not think about politics in ideological terms. What, then, underlies the broad outlines of how citizens think about politics? Building on past work on authoritarianism, we implicate a driving force behind individuals’ political attitudes in their philosophy about life—their “worldview.” We posit that people use beliefs developed from their interactions with their everyday world to inform their affinities and preferences when analogous matters enter the political realm. We theorize and empirically validate a multidimensional measure of worldview in the United States and United Kingdom. Our measure consists of four related, but distinct, dimensions: authority, community, competitiveness, and incrementalism. We show that each is related to support for party identification, ideology, and a range of political attitudes in sensible ways.

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">Abstract</summary>
> This paper examines the signed forecast errors made by state-level pre-election media polls from 1990 through 2020. On average, these polls under-forecast the Republican vote, but only slightly, and with widely varying signs and magnitudes---partly as a function of how the poll is conducted, but more as a function of the campaign and its political context. Underlying many of these political influences is a pattern of partisan straying (at the time of the poll) and subsequent homecoming (by Election Day), in turn affected by both campaign advantages, like outspending one’s opponent, and environmental ones, like the electorate’s being mostly of one’s party. Breaking the signed forecast error apart, we estimate a two-equation SUR model expressing the Republican’s poll share and vote share as functions of campaign and environmental advantages, polling details, and the difference between two “eras,” the more recent marked by heightened politicization and partisanship and an inversion, among whites, of the parties’ previous alignment by education.

> The successful analysis of argumentative techniques from user-generated text is central to many downstream tasks such as political and market analysis. Recent argument mining tools use state-of-the-art deep learning methods to extract and annotate argumentative techniques from various online text corpora, however each task is treated as separate and different bespoke models are fine-tuned for each dataset. We show that different argument mining tasks share common semantic and logical structure by implementing a multi-task approach to argument mining that achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods for the same problems. Our model builds a shared representation of the input text that is common to all tasks and exploits similarities between tasks in order to further boost performance via parameter-sharing. Our results are important for argument mining as they show that different tasks share substantial similarities and suggest a holistic approach to the extraction of argumentative techniques from text.

  <summary markdown="span">Abstract</summary>
> Prevailing theories of public opinion and political psychology hold that human reasoning is biased and lazy, which suggests it is ill-suited to help ordinary citizens engage meaningfully with politics. In contrast, I contend that the biased and lazy nature of reasoning is precisely what gives citizens the tools to think through political issues and update their attitudes in response to argumentative exchanges. To test these hypotheses, I train a series of deep neural networks to classify textual inputs on several characteristics of discussion and argumentation. I use these classifiers to annotate over one million comments from the Reddit social media platform and show that attitude change is substantially more likely to result from argumentative exchanges rather than more contemplative ones. Results suggest that under the right conditions, humans can be quite skilled political reasoners.

  <summary markdown="span">Abstract</summary>
> An antagonistic political culture has long been thought to pose a threat to liberal democracy. More recently, many scholars have proposed a link between political polarization and democratic breakdown, yet causal evidence for this prominent theory remains thin. I present the first broadly comparative analysis of the relationship between mass polarization and democratic backsliding, the modal form of autocratic reversion in the post-third wave era. Panel estimates of ideological and affective polarization from as many as ninety countries and forty-nine years indicate that both ideological and affective polarization exert negligible causal effects on levels of electoral and liberal democracy. To the contrary, results suggest that democratic decline may actually foment mass polarization. Despite widespread concern over the fate of democracy in polarized polities, comparative evidence since the start of the third wave suggests that mass polarization itself poses little threat to democratic regimes.
